To support a focus on teaching in my career moving forward, I am currently studying education technology and learning design (ETLD). I want to use my degree and adult education teaching experience to be an inspiring, informative adult educator. While not currently employed at SFU, I am in discussions regarding a faculty position.  I am interested in learning a greater variety of in-class and online activities. I want to expand my ability to provide feedback to students in a kind and constructive way. I also want to explore ways to spark dialogue, facilitate respectful discussion of opposing views, and to draw reluctant and reticent students into the conversation.\n",
